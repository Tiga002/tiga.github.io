Hi! I am an MSc student at Cranfield University studying Aerospace and Robotics.

My interests intersect with robotics and mechatronics, artificial intelligence and control system.
I am currently working on Learning off-road vehicle traversability using Semantic Segmentation and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Before going back to the University for my master studies, I have started my career by joining the Autonomous Driving Research team in
SenseTime Group Limited as a Researcher Intern once I graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2018. I was involved in researching and implementing different path planning and control algorithms, such as RRT-Star, Lattice Planner, Timed-Elastic-Band Trajectory Optimisation, PID control as well as Model Predictive Control. Besides, I was one of the main developers in the SenseRover Pro Project. SenseRover Pro is a 1:10 scale autonomous driving car that mimics the level-4 autonomous driving system, which was later commercialised as an educational product for different high schools in Hong Kong and Mainland China.

After working for a year, I switched to a more research-oriented job â€“ Research Assistant at The Chinese University of Hong
Kong. I was under the supervision of Prof. ZHOU Bolei in the Multimedia Lab (MMLab), which is one of the pioneering institutes
on deep learning. My research focuses on Mobile Robot Navigation, Robot Arm Manipulation, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.
