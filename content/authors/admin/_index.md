Hi! I am a Junior Research Assistant at the Multimedia Lab of The Chinese University of Hong Kong advised by Professor Zhou Bolei.

My research interests are intersect with robotics and mechatronics, artificial intelligence and control system.
I'm currently working on robotics grasping using low-cost-robotics-arm with the manner of Imitation Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning,
but i'm generally interest in robotic learning, navigation, and control.

Prior to my research experience at CUHK, I was working in SenseTime Group Limited as a Researcher Intern.
I was one of the members in the Autonomous Driving Research Group. Participated research and development work related to path planning and control.

Besides, I'm super passionate on building mobile robots, which requires the knowledge and experience on both hardware and software prototyping.
I have designed and developed a 1/10 scale fully autonomous car that mimic the autonomous driving system pipeline.
